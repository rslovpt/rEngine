Hello!

This is a 3D Engine i made in C. Though it's the basics, and it still has much to be worked on, it is still very usable.
This was my first big project in C, and I will keep working on it through time. 
Check out src/main.c to see how to run and use it, otherwise, you are free to roam around the code and use it in any way you desire.
